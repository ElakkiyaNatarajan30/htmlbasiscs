                <p>Computers are commonly grouped into three kinds, dependent on how they process data. 
                    To this end, they have delegated the simple, digital, and hybrid computers. 
                    This characterization decides the speed and precision of every computer.</p>

                <p>The human body is very complex. It is like a job. You have to do a million things in one day to make it through the day. 
                    The body uses nine systems to do all of those jobs. They all have separate functions, but some work together. Each system is also made up of organs. 
                    There are many ways to care and protect the systems from the many different problems they can have. </p>
